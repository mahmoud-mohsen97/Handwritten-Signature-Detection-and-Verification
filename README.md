# Problem Statement
Authentication is an important factor to manage security. Signatures are widely used for personal identification and verification. Many documents like  legal  transaction  and  bank  cheque  requires  signature  verification. Signature-based verification of a multiple number of documents is a time-consuming and difficulttask. Consequently, an explosive growth has been seen  in  biometric  personal  verification  and  authentication  systems astraditional identity verification methods such as passwords, tokens, pins suffer  from  some  fatal  flaws  and  are  incapable  to  satisfy  security necessities. In this project will be tasked with identifying whether a handwritten signatureis real or forged and detecting the signature in a document.
